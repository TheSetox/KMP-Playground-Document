# DataRepository

A `DataRepository` acts as a bridge between the application and its 
data sources like databases or APIs. 

It handles tasks related to accessing and managing data, 
providing a simplified interface for the rest of the application to 
interact with. 

By abstracting away the complexities of data storage, 
it ensures that the application's core logic remains independent 
of specific data sources. 

This promotes organization and ease of maintenance while allowing 
for flexibility in adapting to changes in data sources.

## Current code

```Kotlin
class DataRepository(
    private val source: Source = DataSource()
): Repository {
    override fun getPlatform() = source.getPlatform()
}
```

### getPlatform
{collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```Kotlin
    override fun getPlatform() = source.getPlatform()
```

The `getPlatform()` function retrieves platform-specific information 
using the `source` data source. 

It delegates the task of obtaining platform details to the source object,
which is typically an instance of the `DataSource` class. 

This approach allows the `DataRepository` to remain agnostic to the 
specific implementation details of the data source, promoting 
modularity and flexibility in the codebase. 

The `getPlatform()` function ensures that the repository provides 
consistent access to platform information, regardless of the 
underlying data source being used.
