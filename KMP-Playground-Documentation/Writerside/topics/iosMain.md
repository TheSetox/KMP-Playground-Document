# iosMain

This is for the iOS side. But most of the time, you won't
add anything here.

You only need to add more `Controller` for specific scenarios.

## Sample Code

_MainViewController.kt_
```Kotlin
import androidx.compose.ui.window.ComposeUIViewController

fun MainViewController() = ComposeUIViewController { App() }
```
